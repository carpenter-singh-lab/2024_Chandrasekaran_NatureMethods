# Datasheet: CPJUMP1 dataset

Authors: Niranj Chandrasekararan (@niranjchandrasekaran), Shantanu Singh (@shntnu)

Organization: Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard

## Maintenance

*As with the previous section, dataset creators should provide answers to these questions prior to distributing the dataset. These questions are intended to encourage dataset creators to plan for dataset maintenance and communicate this plan with dataset consumers.*

1. **Who is supporting/hosting/maintaining the dataset?**

	*The image data is hosted on AWS Open Data (s3://cellpainting-gallery/jump-pilot/source_4) while the well-level aggregated profiles are on the GitHub repo (see https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/neurips-cpjump1#data-organization). We will continue to maintain the repo and respond to queries via GitHub issues (https://github.com/jump-cellpainting/neurips-cpjump1/issues).*

2. **How can the owner/curator/manager of the dataset be contacted (e.g. email address)?**

	*The curators can be contacted via email or via GitHub issues Niranj Chandrasekaran (csriniva@broadinstitute.org; @niranjchandrasekaran), Shantanu Singh (shsingh@broadinstitute.org; @shntnu).*

3. **Is there an erratum?** If so, please provide a link or other access point.

	*There is no erratum.*

4. **Will the dataset be updated (e.g. to correct labeling errors, add new instances, delete instances)?** If so, please describe how often, by whom, and how updates will be communicated to users (e.g. mailing list, GitHub)?

	*The profiles may be updated by the curators and the updates will be announced via GitHub. The images will likely not be updated.*

5. **If the dataset relates to people, are there applicable limits on the retention of the data associated with the instances (e.g. were individuals in question told that their data would be retained for a fixed period of time and then deleted)?** If so, please describe these limits and explain how they will be enforced.

	*This dataset does not relate to people.*

6. **Will older versions of the dataset continue to be supported/hosted/maintained?** If so, please describe how. If not, please describe how its obsolescence will be communicated to users.

	*The older versions of the profiles will continue to be hosted on the GitHub repository. It is unlikely that the images will be updated.*

7. **If others want to extend/augment/build on/contribute to the dataset, is there a mechanism for them to do so?** If so, please provide a description. Will these contributions be validated/verified? If so, please describe how. If not, why not? Is there a process for communicating/distributing these contributions to other users? If so, please provide a description.

	*Currently there is no mechanism for others to extend/augment/build on/contribute to this dataset*
